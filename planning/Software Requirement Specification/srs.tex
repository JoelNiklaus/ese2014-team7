\chapter{Introduction}
\section{Purpose}
This document is the Software Requirements Specification for the ESE 2014 apartment- and shared room search platform project. This software aims to provide a practical and easy to use environment for searching for apartments and shared rooms, as well as placing advertisements for such. \\
This document is meant for our customer and us, the development team, to deliver a common base and detailed description of all the criteria the software should meet in the end. 
\section{Stakeholders}
Bledar Aga, ESE Team 7, students looking for a room to rent
\section{Definitions}
\textbf{Searcher:} A person who wants to find a room in a shared apartment.\\
\textbf{Provider:} A person who wants to find a person for a room in his/her apartment.
\section{System Overview}
The purpose is to provide a system where a Searcher can find a shared apartment and a Provider can place an ad for a shared apartment. \\
Our goal is to out beat the market with further methods for scheduling an appointment for visiting a shared apartment.
\section{References}
Concerning main functionalities, such as placing an ad and searching for an apartment or shared room, we will take these following websites as examples:\\
\begin{itemize}
\item \url{www.wgzimmer.ch}
\item \url{www.students.ch/wohnen/} 
\item \url{www.tutti.ch/ganze-schweiz/immobilien/wg-zimmer} 
\end{itemize}

We will analyze their features and behavior to filter out good practice and improve their weaknesses.
